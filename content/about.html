  <h1>Work sucks but life is sweet.
    <br>
    Eat a tarte.</h1>
  <p>
    On a Saturday afternoon in mid-September, I stood in my kitchen rolling dough for a tarte that I was making for dinner with friends. The thoughts in my head were all about the previous work-week, and boy was it bleak! It occurred to me that the action of making a tarte for my friends was way more fun.
    I had been cooking breads, making pastas and tartes for friends for years. So in that moment I decided to make and share more tartes with the goal of reminding myself that tartes (and friends) trump work: So take that work! We have tartes to eat.

    So get a tarte, share with friends and taste the sweet taste of leaving scary, angry shit behind.
